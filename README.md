# Python NN_Template and Project Hand Writing Recognizing (HWR)

### Project

- **NN_Template** : A python class for universe NN project

- **HWR**: read a picture of any resolution, then give which number it is

  >  Test by mnist **train.csv** and **test.csv**, when set epochs=7 and rotate_expand=5 Pi/180, it reachs 97% for accuracy.
- **Back_Transport**: We set the result and reversely to generate the img, which may provide new sight of NN.

- **Epoch_Trend**: To find which which epoch can help us get the maximal and most stable accuracy, which may give idea in batch_size choice in pytorch.

- **Rotate_trend**: For 60000 pictures(28 * 28 * 1 matrix), we can use rotate expand to get more training data to get more correctness.

### Test

- 2019.2.26 update queryback, it can get 0~9 image by running.\n

- 2019.2.26 try to rotate mnist_dataset to improve the performance in testing.

- 2019.2.26 Dell  CMD   -complete_experiment  time:~  result:95.67%

- 2019.2.27 MacBook  sublime   -complete_experiment  time:612.1s    result:96.57%

- 2019.3.6 ThinkStation sublime -complete_experiment time:~ result:96.49%

- 2019.5.1 update to support read and save .npy to continue/stop training.
